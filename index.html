<h1>Leo P plays baritone saxophone</h1>
<h2>He graduated from the Manhattan School of Music in 2013.</h2>
<p>Pellegrino is perhaps best known for his impressive dance moves while 
performing on the baritone saxophone. A number of videos with Pellegrino have 
gained wide popularity on YouTube, due in equal parts to his playing, 
dancing, and loud hair and dress styles.</p>
